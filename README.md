Project_1: - A form like console app that takes inputs from the user and generates several variables.


Project_2: - Math Operators and Comparisons is a console app that takes various methods programmed into a class and yields an assortment of results for the user.

 
Project_3: - Insurability Program is a console app that utilizes methods within a class object as inspection elements to verify that the user is insurable based on thier input and programmed in criterion.


Project_4: - Package Express is a console app which applies verification controls inside of classes to qualify shipability and produces different cost estimates based on the user's input.  


Project_5: - Do While Loop is a console app that utilizes indexing through an array, intitializes an index value to navigate and replies with the respective value until a limitation is encountered.


Project_6: - Lists and arrays is a console app that contains several arrays and lists and utilizes if rules, foreach loops and yields different results pertaining to key/value pairs.


Project_7: - This is a console app that analyzes some lists and arrays, produces multiple results or singular results according to the conditions set in the loops and if statements.


Project_8: - Error Handling is a console app that receives input of integer type and incorporates a try/catch block and a finally block in order to make sure the program doesn't crash.


Project_10: - Thermal Value Calculator is a console app that a user selects the type of input they are applying and the class has a corresponding method.  This incorporates if rules, foreach loops and contains separate class files.


Project_11: - Assorted Methods is a console app that utilizes input from the user to determine the correct method of which to apply for acheiving the desired result.


Project_14: - Abstract Inheritence Example includes a console app that applies parameters through a base class and an inherited class to produce several results.


Project_16: - Double Equals Overload is a console app that contains a class with some overloaded methods and produces a result from pre-coded elements to add to the result.


Project_17: - Lambda Example is a console app that produces a new list as a result of a Lambda Function limiting the elements passed out of a pre-coded list. 


Project_18: - DateTime example is a console app that passes a user unput through a class object and produces a time in the future contingent upon the current date and time.


Project_19: - Constructor Chain is a console app that has pre-coded values within a class and a constant is applied to the program which calls these items to chain through one another for producing the final result.


Code First DB: - A code generated database has some information added to it and read from it.  This is a console app that applies several classes generated via code and Entity Framework.


Inheritence Example: - This is a console app that applies additional parameters to a base class for the desired result.


Interface-Polymorphism Example: - This is a console app that yields area of pre-coded numbers by passing them through a void class.


Multi-Property Example: - This is a console app that passes a value through a method and displays the original and revised values based on the class constructor.


Two-Results Example: - This is a console app that produces text and numeric results based on Void class elements.  A user inputs a couple values and there are some messages and mathematical functions executed to produce the results.
